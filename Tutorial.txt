Tutorial:

1.  During the game, press keys to select different actions. Each day consists of 8 action turns. Pressing `S` (Clear Screen) or `C` (Check Pet Status) does not consume a turn.
2.  Key game stats:
    *   **Pet Needs to Excrete:** If the pet needs to excrete, each turn waited decreases Happiness and increases Sadness.
    *   **Pet Needs to Eat:** If the pet needs to eat, each turn waited decreases Happiness and increases Sadness.
    *   **Pet Happiness:** Ranges from 0 to 100 (100 is max).
    *   **Pet Sadness:** Ranges from 0 to 50 (50 is max). If Sadness reaches 50, the pet dies.
3.  **Random Events (Triggered on Day >=1 in version 0.1.1+):**
    ①. Pet brings you random money (0~35 dollars; does not trigger if 0).
    ②. Pet acts as your investor. Investing all money increases pet Happiness and decreases Sadness. Results appear after random days. 25% success chance. Returns 10%-50% profit.
    ③. Pet promotes goods. Three sets of goods, triggered with 40%, 40%, and 20% probability respectively.
    ④. Pet forms an avant-garde rock band! Earns you money! (One-time random event, triggers only once).
    ⑤. Pet brings you one of five random cooking ingredients. Quantity is a random number between 1 and 35.
4.  **Loans:**
    *   Press `M` to enter the Money interface.
    *   Loan amount cannot exceed ten times your current money. Cannot loan if money is 0.
    *   Interest rate is random (1% to 10%). Repayment period is a random number of days.
    *   If not repaid by the deadline, the debt increases by the original interest rate each subsequent day.
    *   If debt collectors come and you still can't pay, each occurrence decreases Happiness and increases Sadness.
5.  **Cooking (Instructions):**
    ①. Press `B` on the main screen to view owned cooking ingredients. There are five types: Sugar, Salt, Baking Soda, Water, Flour.
    ②. Press `M` to enter the Money interface to purchase ingredients. Water is free, but total water cannot exceed 1000ml. Air has no purpose; don't be fooled by shady merchants.
    ③. Press `M` to enter the Money interface to cook. The resulting dish's name, flavor, and calories are determined by the quantities of each ingredient. Stored dishes can be viewed by pressing `O` on the main screen.
    ④. In the next version update, selling and using cooked dishes will be added. The current "Discard" function in the `O` interface is just a test for the new inventory system.

7.  **Pet Species:**
    *   There are two pet species: Cat and Dog.

        *   Dog: Random between 1.5 years (548 days) and 5 years (1825 days).
    *   Days spent during the "Pet's Avant-Garde Rock Band" random event do not count towards the pet's lifespan.
    *   **Lifespan Extension:**
        *   Initially, the pet has a random value between 60 and 85 as the Happiness threshold required to increase lifespan.
        *   This threshold increases by 5 points each day until it can no longer increase.
        *   If the pet's Happiness is greater than this threshold value at the time of checking, lifespan increases by 1 day.
        *   Lifespan increase is only checked during **odd-numbered turns** within the day's 8 turns.
